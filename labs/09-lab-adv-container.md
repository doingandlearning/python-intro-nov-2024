# Lab 9: Sets and Dictionaries

Choose one of the activities to implement â€“ if you have time, move on to the other activity.

## Activity 1: Sets

The aim of this activity is to use a **Set**.

1. Create two sets of students: one for those who took an exam and one for those who submitted a project. Use simple strings to represent the students, for example:

   ```python
   # Set up sets
   exam = {'Andrew', 'Kirsty', 'Beth', 'Emily', 'Sue'}
   project = {'Kirsty', 'Emily', 'Ian', 'Stuart'}
   
   # Output the basic sets
   print('exam:', exam)
   print('project:', project)
   ```

2. Using these sets, answer the following questions:

   - Which students took both the exam and submitted a project?
   - Which students only took the exam?
   - Which students only submitted the project?
   - List all students who took either (or both) of the exam and the project.
   - List all students who took either (but not both) of the exam and the project.

## Activity 2: Dictionaries

1. Create a dictionary to represent flights from cities around Europe.

   - The key should be a city.
   - The values should be a tuple containing the flight number, day of the week, time of the flight, and destination (all as strings).

   ```python
   flights = {
       'London': ('EY123', 'Monday', '12:00', 'Geneva'),
       'Geneva': ('AI454', 'Tuesday', '13:00', 'London'),
       'Dublin': ('BA987', 'Wednesday', '14:00', 'Dublin'),
       'Seville': ('SA527', 'Thursday', '11:00', 'Cardiff'),
       'Cardiff': ('WA129', 'Friday', '10:00', 'Dublin')
   }
   ```

2. Perform the following tasks:

   - Print out all the keys.
   - Print out all the values.
   - Find the flight associated with a particular city (e.g., Dublin).
   - Add a new flight for France to the dictionary and print out all the key-value pairs. The flight for France could be `('AF429', 'Saturday', '09:00', 'London')`.
   - Remove the flight from the dictionary for Cardiff and reprint all items.

3. Sample output:

   ```
   Keys: dict_keys(['London', 'Geneva', 'Dublin', 'Seville', 'Cardiff'])
   Values: dict_values([('EY123', 'Monday', '12:00', 'Geneva'), ('AI454', 'Tuesday', '13:00', 'London'), ('BA987', 'Wednesday', '14:00', 'Dublin'), ('SA527', 'Thursday', '11:00', 'Cardiff'), ('WA129', 'Friday', '10:00', 'Dublin')])

   The flight for Dublin is ('BA987', 'Wednesday', '14:00', 'Dublin')

   All key-value pairs: dict_items([('London', ('EY123', 'Monday', '12:00', 'Geneva')), ('Geneva', ('AI454', 'Tuesday', '13:00', 'London')), ('Dublin', ('BA987', 'Wednesday', '14:00', 'Dublin')), ('Seville', ('SA527', 'Thursday', '11:00', 'Cardiff')), ('Cardiff', ('WA129', 'Friday', '10:00', 'Dublin')), ('France', ('AF429', 'Saturday', '09:00', 'London'))])

   Removing the Cardiff flight
   All key-value pairs: dict_items([('London', ('EY123', 'Monday', '12:00', 'Geneva')), ('Geneva', ('AI454', 'Tuesday', '13:00', 'London')), ('Dublin', ('BA987', 'Wednesday', '14:00', 'Dublin')), ('Seville', ('SA527', 'Thursday', '11:00', 'Cardiff')), ('France', ('AF429', 'Saturday', '09:00', 'London'))])
   ```
